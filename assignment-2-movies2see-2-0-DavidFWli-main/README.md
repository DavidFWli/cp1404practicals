# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Movies2See 2.0 by YOUR_NAME

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of movies.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

### Estimate:

4.5 hours

### Actual:

6 hours

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

add double click to delete movie 

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

Double clicking on a movie cannot open only one movie. The deletion option will be opened separately. It will start from the button clicked by the user and open all the deletion options below the button clicked by the user

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

Try to look as beautiful as possible, although it didn't meet my expectations, it was much more beautiful than I initially did

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

yes, I will do it faster and better

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

I used a bunch of stuff to help me out:

Kivy Docs: These were my go-to for figuring out how Kivy works. They've got everything you need to know about Kivy's widgets and how to use them.
Python Docs: Whenever I got stuck on some Python stuff, the official docs were a lifesaver. They've got all the info on Python functions, data types, you name it.
Stack Overflow: Stack Overflow was my best friend whenever I hit a roadblock. I'd search for similar problems and usually find a solution or at least a hint in the right direction.
My Own Know-how: I've been messing around with Python and GUIs for a while, so I had a decent foundation to build on.
Refactoring Tricks: I did a bit of code cleanup to make things easier to read and manage.
All this helped me get through the project and make it better.



## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

There were a few tough parts:

Wrangling Kivy: Kivy has its quirks, so understanding how it handles stuff like events and widgets took some time. I dug into the docs and played around with sample code until it clicked.
Tackling Touch Events: Making sure the double-tap only worked for the right movie button was tricky. I had to really watch those touch events and make sure each button did what it was supposed to.
Keeping It Neat: As the code grew, I had to work hard to keep it clean and organized. Lots of refactoring and renaming to make sure it didn't turn into a mess.
To get through it all, I spent time with the docs, experimented a bunch, and didn't shy away from refactoring when things got messy.
## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

Classes were a game-changer:

Made It Tidy: Using classes helped keep everything neat and tidy. I could group related stuff together, like movie attributes and methods, which made the code easier to follow.
Encapsulated Goodness: With classes, I could bundle up data and functions into nice little packages. Like with the Movie class, it kept all the movie details and actions in one convenient place.
Reusable Bits: Best part was how reusable things got. I could create MovieButtons with all the movie info baked in, so I didn't have to repeat myself all over the place.
Overall, classes made the code cleaner, more readable, and way easier to work with.
